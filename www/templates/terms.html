        </p>
      <p class="para">These restrictions on duplicate listings include listing an identical item in different categories or listing an identical item using different display names. Listings are considered duplicates if they are for items that have no significant differences between them. To avoid your listings from being treated as duplicates, make sure you clearly show the differences between items in the titles, descriptions, barter value, photos, product IDs, item specifics, or parts compatibility areas of a listing. Swaap may also look at other parts of the listing to determine whether it's a duplicate. If the differences between the items you're selling aren't obvious in the search results, your listings may be treated as duplicates and will be subject to the consequences outlined above.</p>
